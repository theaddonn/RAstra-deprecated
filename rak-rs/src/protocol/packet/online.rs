//! Online packets are packets that are sent when the client is connected to the server
//! and are used to keep the connection alive, and to send game packets to the server.
//!
//! The following module provides the following packets:
//! - [`ConnectedPing`]
//! - [`ConnectedPong`]
//! - [`LostConnection`]
//! - [`ConnectionRequest`]
//! - [`ConnectionAccept`]
//! - [`NewConnection`]
//! - [`Disconnect`]
//!
//! During this stage, the client and server are exchanging information about each other,
//! to initialize the connection within raknet, and completing the connection handshake.
